# Formal analysis of the 3-Slot Finality based Ethereum consensus protocol
## Abstract

The current Ethereum consensus protocol is very complex with the LMD-GHOST as the availability sub-protocol and FFG-Casper as the Finality sub-protocol. The next generation candidate protocol, known as 3-Slot Finality (3SF), is less complex, which provides an opportunity for formal verification. This project aims to develop a Dafny model closely aligned with the evolving executable Python specification (https://github.com/saltiniroberto/ssf), enabling the establishment of desirable security properties as lemmas in Dafny under reasonable assumptions about the protocol execution environment. Additionally, this project will investigate potential bugs and vulnerabilities in the 3SF protocol, significantly enhancing confidence in its reliability before its deployment in the Ethereum consensus layer.

## Objectives

*What are you hoping to accomplish with this grant? How do you define and measure success for this project?*

Given the 3SF currently at its design stage, we can apply the traditional formal verification to bridge the gap between the high level description (https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00558) and the low level Python executable (https://github.com/saltiniroberto/ssf). Basically, we will need to produce two Dafny models corresponding to the specifications at both the high level and the low level. The low level Dafny model should refine the high level Dafny model, i.e., the proof results established at the high level model should be preserved in the low level model. Both models will need to cover the dynamic availability (DA) sub-protocol based on TOB-SVD and the finality sub-protocol based on SSF, with the corresponding security requirements proved as lemmas in both models. We specify the following objectives.

### Objective 1: Dafny models for 3SF.
The high level model follows the protocol specification in the technical report (https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00558). All possible behaviors of validators and round (time) progress are specified as predicates that transfer protocol states from one to another, guarded by conditions. The high level model will be produced by hand. The low level model may be created by using existing tools, such as a automatic code transformer (https://hackmd.io/@ericsson49/python-to-dafny-transpiler) or a fine-tuned LLM model, though human intervention is still necessary.

### Objective 2: Security properties (DA confirmation, FFG confirmation, and acountable safety)
We will need to prove security properties in both models. Efforts will be made to migrate proof from the high level model to the low level model via refinement. **Optimistic DA confirmation** should be proved on the DA sub-protocol provided that (1) a certain length of synchronous period is guaranteed and (2) honest validators get a fair chance to propose blocks within that period. **Optimistic FFG confirmation** has similar assumptions, though it should be proved for the FFG sub-protocol. **Accountable safety** should be proved for the FFG sub-protocol on existence of limited asynchrony that in case of two conflicting blocks being finalized, there is a way to identify atleast 1‚ÅÑ3 faulty validators.

The success of the project should be demonstrated in the established Dafny models with either the security properties verified at both the high level model and the low level model, or the properties failed to be proved in a model. Failure at the high level model may expose design errors, and failure at the low level model may indicate issues at the executable Python implementation.

## Outcomes

*How does this project benefit the greater Ethereum ecosystem?*

This project aims to increase the trust guarantees of the Ethereum Consensus Layer specifications. Given its complexity, the current Ethereum consensus protocol Gasper has been exposed of bugs or vulnerabilities in its fork choice Python specification which were fixed with great efforts (https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/2023-fork-choice-reorg-disclosure). A formally verified model at the design stage of next generation Ethereum consensus protocol, even it may adopt a certain degree of abstraction, will benefit the Ethereum ecosystem by strengthening the consensus layer. Moreover, the backend (code generation) of Dafny tool may be used to help generate executable Python implementation with minimum help from human experts.

## Grant Scope

*What are you going to research? What is the expected output?*

We check whether it is feasible to create a Dafny model for a censensus protocol instance as complex as 3SF. In the past Dafny has been used to verify protocols such as DVT (https://github.com/Consensys/distributed-validator-formal-specs-and-verification) and QBFT (https://github.com/Consensys/qbft-formal-spec-and-verification). The 3SF protocol, even at its design stage, is arguably more complex. In this project the main focus is an instance of 3SF which consists of the FFG finality sub-protocol and the TOB-SVD dynamic availability sub-protocol, which together represent an instance of Ebb-and-Flow mechanism.

The expected output is a package of Dafny models representing both a high level spec and a low level spec of the aforementioned 3SF instance protocol.
